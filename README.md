## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later (preferably the latest LTS version)
- Docker
- PNPM

Please make sure you have a Docker daemon running on your machine. This is required for the Supabase CLI to work.

### Installation

#### 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makerkit/next-supabase-saas-kit-lite.git
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### 3. Start Supabase

Please make sure you have a Docker daemon running on your machine.

Then run the following command to start Supabase:

```bash
pnpm run supabase:start
```

Once the Supabase server is running, you can access the Supabase dashboard at http://localhost:54321.

You will also find all the Supabase services printed in the terminal after the command is executed.

##### Stopping Supabase

To stop the Supabase server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:stop
```

##### Resetting Supabase

To reset the Supabase server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:reset
```

#### 4. Start the Next.js application

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

#### 5. Code Health (linting, formatting, etc.)

To format your code, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run format:fix
```

To lint your code, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

To validate your TypeScript code, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```

Turborepo will cache the results of these commands, so you can run them as many times as you want without any performance impact.

### Environment Variables

You can configure the application by setting environment variables in the `.env.local` file.

Here are the available variables:

| Variable Name | Description | Default Value |

## Architecture

This starter kit uses a monorepo architecture.

1. The `apps/web` directory is the Next.js application.
2. The `packages` directory contains all the packages used by the application.
3. The `packages/features` directory contains all the features of the application.
4. The `packages/ui` directory contains all the UI components.

For more information about the architecture, please refer to the [Makerkit blog post about Next.js Project Structure](https://makerkit.dev/blog/tutorials/nextjs-app-router-project-structure).

### Marketing Pages

Marketing pages are located in the `apps/web/app/(marketing)` directory. These pages are used to showcase the features of the SaaS and provide information about the product.

### Authentication

Authenticated is backed by Supabase. The `apps/web/app/auth` directory contains the authentication pages, however, the logic is into its own package `@kit/auth` located in `packages/features/auth`.

This package can be used across multiple applications.

### Gated Pages

Gated pages are located in the `apps/web/app/home` directory. Here is where you can build your SaaS pages that are gated by authentication.

### Database

The Supabase database is located in the `apps/web/supabase` directory. In this directory you will find the database schema, migrations, and seed data.

#### Creating a new migration
To create a new migration, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm --filter web supabase migration new --name <migration-name>
```

This command will create a new migration file in the `apps/web/supabase/migrations` directory. 

#### Applying a migration

Once you have created a migration, you can apply it to the database by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm run supabase:web:reset
```

This command will apply the migration to the database and update the schema. It will also reset the database using the provided seed data.

#### Linking the Supabase database

Linking the local Supabase database to the Supabase project is done by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm --filter web supabase db link
```

This command will link the local Supabase database to the Supabase project.

#### Pushing the migration to the Supabase project

After you have made changes to the migration, you can push the migration to the Supabase project by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm --filter web supabase db push
```

This command will push the migration to the Supabase project. You can now apply the migration to the Supabase database.

#### Supabase Auth URL

When working with a remote Supabase project, you will need to set the Supabase Callback URL.

Please set the callback URL in the Supabase project settings to the following URL:

`<url>/auth/callback`

Where `<url>` is the URL of your application.
