# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Neuroleaf is an AI-powered flashcard application built on MakerKit's Next.js 15 + Supabase Lite starter kit. The application enables users to create flashcards, generate AI-powered content, and study with spaced repetition. The project has been extended with custom features including file upload processing (PDF/DOCX), subscription tiers, and deck limits.

## Common Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server (requires Docker for Supabase)
pnpm run dev

# Start Supabase locally (required before dev)
pnpm run supabase:web:start

# Stop Supabase
pnpm run supabase:web:stop

# Reset Supabase database and apply migrations
pnpm run supabase:web:reset
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Lint all packages
pnpm run lint

# Fix linting issues
pnpm run lint:fix

# Format code
pnpm run format:fix

# Type checking
pnpm run typecheck

# Build for production
pnpm run build
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Create new migration
pnpm --filter web supabase migration new <migration-name>

# Regenerate TypeScript types after schema changes
pnpm --filter web supabase:typegen

# Link to remote Supabase project
pnpm --filter web supabase link

# Push migrations to remote
pnpm --filter web supabase db push
```

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure
- **Turborepo** manages the monorepo with caching and parallel execution
- **apps/web/** - Main Next.js 15 application with App Router
- **packages/features/** - Feature-specific packages (auth, decks, flashcards, ai, subscription)
- **packages/ui/** - Shared UI components using Shadcn UI
- **packages/supabase/** - Database types and shared Supabase utilities

### Key Architectural Patterns

#### Feature Packages
Each feature is isolated in its own package under `packages/features/`:
- **Components**: React components with TypeScript
- **Hooks**: Custom React hooks for data fetching and state management  
- **Schemas**: Zod schemas for validation
- **Server**: Server actions, services, and API logic
- **Services**: Business logic and data processing

#### Database Layer
- **Supabase** for authentication, database, and real-time features
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** enforced on all tables
- **Database types** auto-generated in `packages/supabase/src/database.types.ts`
- **Migrations** in `apps/web/supabase/migrations/`

#### UI Components
- **Shadcn UI** components in `packages/ui/src/shadcn/`
- **Custom components** in `packages/ui/src/makerkit/`
- **Import pattern**: `@kit/ui/[component-name]` (e.g., `@kit/ui/button`)

### Core Features

#### Authentication (`@kit/auth`)
- Supabase-based authentication with multiple providers
- Email/password, magic links, and OAuth support
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) support
- Password reset and account management

#### Decks Management (`@kit/decks`)
- CRUD operations for flashcard decks
- Deck sharing and collaboration
- Deck filtering, searching, and sorting
- **Subscription limits enforced** in deck creation

#### Flashcards (`@kit/flashcards`)
- Individual flashcard CRUD operations
- AI-powered flashcard generation using Gemini API
- File upload support (PDF, DOCX, TXT) with server-side processing
- Rich text editing for flashcard content

#### AI Integration (`@kit/ai`)
- **Gemini API** integration for content generation
- Text enhancement and flashcard generation services
- Content extraction from uploaded files

#### Subscription System (`@kit/subscription`)
- Two tiers: Free (3 decks), Pro (unlimited decks)
- Deck creation limits enforced at service and UI levels
- Subscription info display and upgrade prompts
- Full Stripe integration for payment processing

### Data Flow

#### Client-Side
1. **React Components** use custom hooks from feature packages
2. **Hooks** call server actions for data mutations
3. **React Query** manages caching and state synchronization
4. **Zod schemas** validate all form inputs

#### Server-Side
1. **Server Actions** in feature packages handle mutations
2. **Service classes** contain business logic and database operations
3. **Supabase client** handles database queries with RLS
4. **Subscription limits** checked before deck creation/duplication

### File Upload Processing
- **Server Actions** handle file uploads (no client-side processing)
- **pdf2json** for PDF text extraction
- **mammoth** for DOCX text extraction
- **Next.js configuration** includes `serverComponentsExternalPackages: ['pdf2json']`

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses local Supabase instance via Docker
- **Environment variables** managed in `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`
- **App configuration** centralized in `apps/web/config/app.config.ts`
- **Feature flags** available for toggling functionality

### Database Schema
- **accounts** - User accounts with subscription tiers
- **decks** - Flashcard decks with RLS
- **flashcards** - Individual cards linked to decks
- **user_progress** - Spaced repetition tracking
- **study_sessions** - Learning session analytics
- **ai_generations** - AI usage tracking

### Package Dependencies
- Internal packages use `@kit/` namespace
- UI components imported as `@kit/ui/[component-name]`
- Feature packages imported as `@kit/[feature-name]/[export]`
- **Turborepo** handles dependency management and build orchestration

### Testing Strategy
- **Playwright** configured for end-to-end testing
- **Type safety** enforced with strict TypeScript configuration
- **Linting** with ESLint v9 and **formatting** with Prettier
- **Pre-commit hooks** ensure code quality

## Important Notes

- Always run `pnpm run supabase:web:start` before development
- After schema changes, regenerate types with `pnpm --filter web supabase:typegen`
- Subscription limits are enforced in both service layer and UI
- File uploads use server-side processing to avoid bundle size issues
- Import UI components using individual exports: `@kit/ui/button` not `@kit/ui/shadcn/button`

# MVP Development Plan & Progress Tracking

## Current Status (Updated: January 28, 2025)

### âœ… Completed Foundation
- **Core Infrastructure**: Next.js 15 + Supabase + TypeScript monorepo
- **Authentication**: Complete user auth with Supabase
- **Database Schema**: Full flashcard/deck schema with RLS policies
- **Deck Management**: Complete CRUD operations with modern UI
- **Basic Subscription Framework**: Tier system with limits configuration
- **AI Integration**: Gemini client setup with content analysis
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive design system and marketing pages

### ðŸš§ Phase 1: Core MVP Completion (In Progress)
