Thermodynamics: Laws and Principles

Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that deals with heat, temperature, energy, and work. It describes how energy is transferred and transformed in physical systems.

Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. It determines the direction of heat flow between objects. Heat always flows from higher temperature to lower temperature objects until thermal equilibrium is reached.

The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics states that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other. This law provides the basis for temperature measurement.

The First Law of Thermodynamics is the law of conservation of energy. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted from one form to another. Mathematically, ΔU = Q - W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is heat added to the system, and W is work done by the system.

Internal energy is the total energy contained within a system, including kinetic and potential energies of particles. Work in thermodynamics is the energy transfer that occurs when a force acts through a distance, such as when a gas expands against external pressure.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system always increases over time. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. This law implies that heat engines cannot be 100% efficient and that certain processes are irreversible.

A heat engine converts thermal energy into mechanical work by operating between two thermal reservoirs at different temperatures. The efficiency of a heat engine is limited by the Carnot efficiency: η = 1 - (T_cold/T_hot), where temperatures are in Kelvin.

The Third Law of Thermodynamics states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero temperature is exactly zero. This law provides an absolute reference point for entropy calculations.

Thermodynamic processes include isothermal (constant temperature), adiabatic (no heat exchange), isobaric (constant pressure), and isochoric (constant volume) processes. Each process follows specific relationships between pressure, volume, temperature, and energy.

Phase transitions occur when matter changes from one state to another, such as melting, boiling, or sublimation. These transitions involve latent heat, which is energy absorbed or released without temperature change.

The ideal gas law, PV = nRT, relates pressure, volume, temperature, and amount of gas. Real gases deviate from ideal behavior at high pressures and low temperatures due to intermolecular forces and finite molecular size.
