Climate Change: Causes, Effects, and Geographic Impact

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations occur naturally, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the dominant driver of climate change since the mid-20th century.

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms Earth's surface. Solar radiation passes through the atmosphere and heats the Earth's surface. The surface then emits infrared radiation, which is absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, trapping heat and warming the planet.

Primary greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and fluorinated gases. Carbon dioxide, primarily from burning fossil fuels, accounts for about 76% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation also contributes by reducing CO₂ absorption by trees.

Global average temperatures have risen by approximately 1.1°C (2°F) since the late 19th century. The last decade has been the warmest on record. Arctic regions are warming twice as fast as the global average, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification.

Rising sea levels result from thermal expansion of warming oceans and melting ice sheets and glaciers. Current sea level rise is about 3.3 millimeters per year. Small island nations and coastal cities face increasing flood risks and potential displacement of populations.

Extreme weather events are becoming more frequent and intense. These include heat waves, droughts, wildfires, hurricanes, and flooding. The increased frequency reflects changes in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns caused by global warming.

Arctic ice loss has accelerated dramatically. The Arctic sea ice extent has declined by about 13% per decade. The Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets are losing mass at increasing rates, contributing to sea level rise and affecting global ocean circulation.

Ocean acidification occurs as oceans absorb excess atmospheric CO₂, forming carbonic acid. This process threatens marine ecosystems, particularly organisms with calcium carbonate shells and skeletons, including corals, mollusks, and some plankton species.

Climate change affects precipitation patterns globally. Some regions experience increased drought, while others face more intense rainfall and flooding. These changes impact agriculture, water resources, and human settlements.

Ecosystem disruption includes shifts in species distributions, timing of biological events, and food chain relationships. Many species face extinction risks due to habitat loss and changing environmental conditions. Coral bleaching events have become more frequent and severe.

Regional impacts vary significantly. Sub-Saharan Africa faces increased drought and food insecurity. Small island states confront existential threats from sea level rise. The Mediterranean region experiences increased heat and water stress. Arctic communities face infrastructure challenges from permafrost thaw.

Mitigation strategies include transitioning to renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, protecting and restoring forests, and developing carbon capture technologies. International cooperation through agreements like the Paris Climate Accord aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
