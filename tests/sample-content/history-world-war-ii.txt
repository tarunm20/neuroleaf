World War II: Key Events and Timeline

World War II was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945, involving most of the world's nations. It was the deadliest conflict in human history, resulting in an estimated 70-85 million deaths.

The war began on September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. The conflict initially involved European powers but eventually became truly global.

Major causes of the war included the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles, the global economic depression, the rise of totalitarian regimes, and the failure of the League of Nations to maintain peace.

Key figures included Adolf Hitler, who led Nazi Germany and initiated the Holocaust; Winston Churchill, who led Britain through its darkest hours; Franklin D. Roosevelt, who guided America's entry into the war; and Joseph Stalin, who led the Soviet Union's resistance against Germany.

The war had two main theaters: the European Theater and the Pacific Theater. In Europe, major battles included the Battle of Britain (1940), Operation Barbarossa (1941), the Battle of Stalingrad (1942-1943), and D-Day (1944).

The Holocaust was Nazi Germany's systematic genocide of six million Jews and millions of others, including Roma, disabled individuals, political prisoners, and Soviet POWs. It remains one of history's most horrific atrocities.

In the Pacific, Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, bringing the United States into the war. Major Pacific battles included Midway (1942), Guadalcanal (1942-1943), and Iwo Jima (1945).

The war in Europe ended on May 8, 1945 (V-E Day), after Hitler's suicide and Germany's unconditional surrender. The Pacific war continued until Japan surrendered on August 15, 1945 (V-J Day), following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

The war's aftermath led to the emergence of the United States and Soviet Union as superpowers, the beginning of the Cold War, the creation of the United Nations, and significant changes in the global political landscape.
