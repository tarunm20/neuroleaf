## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy Content**: Select and copy the text from any of these files
2. **Create New Deck**: Go to the deck creation dialog in Neuroleaf
3. **Paste Content**: Paste the copied text into the content textarea
4. **Generate Cards**: Choose number of cards (5-25) and difficulty level
5. **Test Generation**: Click "Create & Generate Cards" to test the AI generation

## Testing Suggestions

- **Vary Content Length**: Test with full articles vs. shorter excerpts
- **Different Difficulties**: Try easy/medium/hard settings with the same content
- **Card Quantities**: Test different numbers of cards (5, 10, 15, 20, 25)
- **Subject Variety**: Test across different academic disciplines
- **Complex vs. Simple**: Compare technical content (calculus) with narrative content (history)

## Expected Outcomes

The AI should generate contextually appropriate flashcards that:
- Extract key concepts and definitions
- Create clear, specific questions
- Provide comprehensive answers
- Vary question types (definition, explanation, application, comparison)
- Include relevant tags for categorization
- Assign appropriate difficulty levels

These test files provide comprehensive coverage for validating the flashcard generation system across diverse academic content.
